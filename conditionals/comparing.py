# Python can be used to compare values to each other.
# We use Operators to perform comparisons, and can compare Equations or Strings. We can look to see if something is bigger than, smaller than or equal to another value
# A comparison operation results in a boolean output of True or False
# Other than equality, you can't do a comparison between different data types, like a string and int
